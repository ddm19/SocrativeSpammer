# SocrativeSpammer
A bot that enters on a room on socrative multiple times (also makes answers)

The bot uses node and puppeteer, so make sure to install them before you run it.
The bot is prepared to spam socrative rooms that dont require name, but if it does, its simply editable.

Once you installed node and puppeteer you can run the bot 2 ways:
1- Edit ClickableSpammer.bat to put the room, the quantity and the answer (optional), then run it as many times as u want (the more u run , the faster it will go)
2- Run on cmd "node SocrativeSpammer.js ROOM QUANTITY ANSWER(OPTIONAL)"

This bot is made with the purpose of having fun, so dont be retard and dont use it many times in class :/
